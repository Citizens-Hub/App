## 🎯 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Choose Your Targets

Start by selecting your **starting ship** and **destination ship**. Drag them from the ship selector onto the canvas.

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Look for Warbond (WB) packages at the top of the ship selector - they're your key to massive savings!

### 2️⃣ Build Your Chain

Enable **historical WB display** to see ships that previously had Warbond offers. Ships with past WB sales are likely to have future ones!

![Building Chain](https://citizenshub.app/imgs/tutorial/04.png)

> ⚠️ **Important**: Historical WBs must be manually selected in the edit path menu. Only current WBs and your hangar CCUs connect automatically.


### 3️⃣ View Your Route

### Multiple Path Planning

Can't decide between official WB or third-party purchase? **Compare both routes!**

### Store Credit Optimization

Factor in your store credit strategy:

```
Real Cost = Money Spent + (Lost Store Credit × Credit Value %)
```

**Configure in the right panel:**
- 💳 Set store credit acquisition cost (e.g., 10% for reselling)
- 🚀 Add starting ship purchase cost
- 📈 See true total investment

![Store Credit](https://citizenshub.app/imgs/tutorial/08.png)

> 💡 **Don't need store credit?** Set the value to **0%**
